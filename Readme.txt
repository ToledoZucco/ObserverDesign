Using these codes one can design the observer gain for a specific state feedback in such a way that the observer is strictly positive real. This allows to guarantee closed-loop stability when the observer-based state feedback controller is applied to either a boundary controlled port-Hamiltonian system or a nonlinear output-strictly passive and zero-state detectable.
